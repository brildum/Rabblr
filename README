Rabblr is a Bookmarklet that allows you to chat on any website. It is running on
http://rabblr.com for anyone to use.

There are 2 components:

1. JavaScript client (using sockjs, jQuery)
2. Python server (using Tornado, sockjs-tornado)

To build the client, download yuicompressor from Yahoo and run:

make build

This will create the following files in the static/ directory:

1. A single JavaScript file (with all JS included), minimized using yuicompressor
2. A single CSS file
3. Bootstrap-based HTML files for the Rabblr homepage
